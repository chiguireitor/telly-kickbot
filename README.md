A bot made to manage groups based on counterparty token holdings.

Usage:
==

* `git clone` this repo, cd into the new dir
* `npm install`
* Copy `config.json_example` to `config.json` and modify accordingly
* `node index.js`

For production use, run with `pm2` or any other supervisor.

You'll probably need a https://github.com/chiguireitor/cryptoauthproxy instance running for it to work correctly.

Have a request, need a feature? @chiguireitor on telegram to ask.
